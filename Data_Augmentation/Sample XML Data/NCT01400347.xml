  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>It is generally accepted that the effectiveness of an exercise can be controlled not only&#xd;
by the weight or resistance applied but also by doing an exercise that would better&#xd;
target the desired muscle. The purpose of this study is to obtain objective information&#xd;
regarding selected lower extremity muscle activity during specific exercise and the&#xd;
influence of fatigue and speed on muscular activation.</textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>It is generally accepted that the effectiveness of an exercise can be controlled not only&#xd;
by the weight or resistance applied but also by doing an exercise that would better&#xd;
target the desired muscle. Information regarding selected lower extremity muscle activity&#xd;
during specific exercise and the influence of fatigue and speed on muscular activation&#xd;
may enhance exercise prescription for all parties involved. Specifically, selection of&#xd;
specific training or rehabilitation exercises may be guided by increased awareness of&#xd;
specific muscle activation patterns during common exercises.&#xd;
&#xd;
Methods and Measures: Healthy subjects between 18 - 35 years old will be recruited from&#xd;
the community by a sample of convenience and word of mouth. Potential participants will&#xd;
report to the Institute for Human Performance. The potential participants will be asked&#xd;
to complete all documentation including informed consent, and health screening&#xd;
questionnaire. The qualified participants will be familiarized with the set up and&#xd;
specific exercises. If eligible, surface EMG recordings will be collected from the back&#xd;
extensors, gluteal muscles (buttocks), hamstrings (posterior thigh), quadriceps (anterior&#xd;
thigh), and gastrocnemius (calf) during squat and lunges exercises.&#xd;
&#xd;
For data analysis, a within subject measures analysis will be conducted using general&#xd;
linear models. Specifically, we will use paired t-tests and an analysis of variance&#xd;
(ANOVA). When applicable, post-hoc tests will be used to uncover differences among the&#xd;
groups of subjects on descriptor variables such as age, height, weight, rate of perceived&#xd;
exertion, and maximal and sub-maximal voluntary muscle performance variables (i.e. EMG&#xd;
amplitude, frequency). The statistical significance level will be set at alpha = 0.05 for&#xd;
all analyses performed.</textblock>

      <textblock>We will recruit healthy, young (18-35 y.o.) subjects. Following signing the inform&#xd;
consent, potential participants will be given a health risk questionnaires to identify&#xd;
possible cardiovascular and/or orthopedic risks to strength training exercise. Answering&#xd;
YES to any of the questions on the PAR Q will be considered an exclusion criterion. In&#xd;
addition we will use a MEDICAL HISTORY QUESTIONNAIRE (included at the end of this form).&#xd;
Specifically, subjects who are at risk due to recent (within the last year)&#xd;
neuro-musculo-skeletal injury to lower extremities will be excluded from the study. Also,&#xd;
we will exclude subjects who reported any significant respiratory-cardiovascular disease,&#xd;
which is not yet under control..</textblock>
