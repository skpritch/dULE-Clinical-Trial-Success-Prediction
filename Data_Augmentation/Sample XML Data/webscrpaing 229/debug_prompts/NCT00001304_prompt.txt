Title: Treatment of Hypoparathyroidism With Synthetic Human Parathyroid Hormone 1-34
Overall Status: COMPLETED
Phases: PHASE2
Enrollment: 27 (ACTUAL)

=== DETAILED OUTCOME MEASURES ===

1. SECONDARY OUTCOME: Serum 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D Level
   Description: Measurements were taken 1 hour before the morning dose of PTH or, calcitriol and calcium; UOM = pg/ml. Measurements were obtained on three successive days (three separate measures) semiannually at the NIH CC for each protocol subject. The average data are the average of these three semi-annual data points for each subject which are then averaged across all the semi-annual means for all subjects within each arm over the three years of study.
   Time Frame: 3 years
   Unit of Measure: pg/ml
   Results:
      Results:
        Calcitriol and Calcium: 40
        PTH 1-34: 43

2. SECONDARY OUTCOME: Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D Level
   Description: Measurements were taken 1 hour before the morning dose of PTH or, calcitriol and calcium; UOM = ng/ml. Measurements were obtained on three successive days (three separate measures) semiannually at the NIH CC for each protocol subject. The average data are the average of these three semi-annual data points for each subject which are then averaged across all the semi-annual means for all subjects within each arm over the three years of study.
   Time Frame: 3 years
   Unit of Measure: ng/ml
   Results:
      Results:
        Calcitriol and Calcium: 31
        PTH 1-34: 28

3. PRIMARY OUTCOME: Serum Calcium Level
   Description: Measurements were taken 1 hour before the morning dose of PTH or, calcitriol and calcium; UOM = mmol/liter, normal range 2.05-2.5. Measurements were obtained on three successive days (three separate measures) semiannually at the NIH CC for each protocol subject. The average data are the average of these three semi-annual data points for each subject which are then averaged across all the semi-annual means for all subjects within each arm over the three years of study.
   Time Frame: 3 years
   Unit of Measure: mmol/liter

        Calcitriol and Calcium: 2
        PTH 1-34: 1.92

4. SECONDARY OUTCOME: Serum Magnesium Level
   Description: Measurements were taken 1 hour before the morning dose of PTH or, calcitriol and calcium; UOM = mmol/liter, normal range 0.65-1.05. Measurements were obtained on three successive days (three separate measures) semiannually at the NIH CC for each protocol subject. The average data are the average of these three semi-annual data points for each subject which are then averaged across all the semi-annual means for all subjects within each arm over the three years of study.
   Time Frame: 3 years
   Unit of Measure: mmol/liter
   Results:
      Results:
        Calcitriol and Calcium: 0.75
        PTH 1-34: 0.73

5. SECONDARY OUTCOME: Serum Phosphorus Level
   Description: Measurements were taken 1 hour before the morning dose of PTH or, calcitriol and calcium; UOM = mmol/liter, normal range 0.7-1.4. Measurements were obtained on three successive days (three separate measures) semiannually at the NIH CC for each protocol subject. The average data are the average of these three semi-annual data points for each subject which are then averaged across all the semi-annual means for all subjects within each arm over the three years of study.
   Time Frame: 3 years
   Unit of Measure: mmol/liter
   Results:
      Results:
        Calcitriol and Calcium: 4.5
        PTH 1-34: 4.6

6. SECONDARY OUTCOME: Urinary Creatinine Clearance
   Description: Measurements were taken 1 hour before the morning dose of PTH or, calcitriol and calcium; UOM = ml/min, normal range 90-125. Measurements were obtained on three successive days (three separate measures) semiannually at the NIH CC for each protocol subject. The average data are the average of these three semi-annual data points for each subject which are then averaged across all the semi-annual means for all subjects within each arm over the three years of study.
