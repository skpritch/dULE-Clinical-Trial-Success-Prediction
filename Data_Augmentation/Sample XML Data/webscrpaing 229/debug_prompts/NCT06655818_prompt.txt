=== DETAILED OUTCOME MEASURES ===

1. PRIMARY OUTCOME: DE Phase: Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT)
   Description: Criteria for dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) included hematologic indicators such as Grade 3-5 febrile neutropenia and thrombocytopenia with bleeding. Non-hematologic criteria, excluding corneal toxicity, comprise Grade 3-5 toxicities, with exceptions for manageable nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, controlled Grade 3 hypertension, and events linked to disease progression. Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) of Grade 3 or 4, successfully managed within 7 days without end-organ damage, is considered. Corneal toxicity, assessed by the GSK corneal grading scale at Grade 4, is a DLT. Other organ-specific toxicities, notably liver toxicity meeting GSK stopping criteria, also qualify as DLTs. Severity was graded using National Cancer Institute - Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 5.0).
   Time Frame: Up to 21 days
   Unit of Measure: Participants

        1.9 mg/kg Belantamab Mafodotin + 500mg Dostarlimab: 1

2. PRIMARY OUTCOME: DE Phase: Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs)
   Description: An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. AEs were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) coding system.
   Time Frame: Up to 153 weeks
   Unit of Measure: Participants

      Results:
        1.9 mg/kg Belantamab Mafodotin + 500mg Dostarlimab: 4

3. PRIMARY OUTCOME: DE Phase: Number of Participants With Worst-Case Hematology Results by Maximum Grade Increase Post - Baseline Relative to Baseline
   Description: Blood samples were collected for the analysis of following hematology parameters: eosinophils, anemia, hemoglobin increased, lymphocyte count decreased, lymphocyte count increased, neutrophil count decreased, platelet count decreased, leukocytosis and white blood cell decreased. Grade 1 (G1): mild; Grade 2 (G2): moderate; Grade 3 (G3): severe; Grade 4 (G4) life-threatening or disabling. Higher grade indicates greater severity and an increase in CTCAE grade was defined relative to the Baseline grade. Any worst-case post baseline increase to G1, G2, G3, and G4 are presented. The laboratory parameters were graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.
