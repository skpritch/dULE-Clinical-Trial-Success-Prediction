If a sample was confirmed as an ADA true positive, ADA titer was assessed. ADA-positive was defined as participants who have confirmed positive ADA status in at least 1 postbaseline assessments. ADA-negative was defined as participants who did not have a confirmed positive ADA status in any postbaseline assessment. For ADA-positive only, high ADA titer was defined as participant who had at least 1 postbaseline ADA titer \>16; low ADA titer was defined as participant whose postbaseline ADA titers were all ≤16 and data is presented accordingly for each of these categories.
