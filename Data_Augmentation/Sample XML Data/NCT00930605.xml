  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>  1. Primary Research Question What are the rates of complete response (CR), partial&#xd;
     response (PR), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in adult&#xd;
     patients newly diagnosed with Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma (PTCL) who are treated with&#xd;
     alemtuzumab given in combination with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin,&#xd;
     vincristine and prednisolone) and ESHAP (etoposide, methylprednisolone, cisplatin,&#xd;
     cytosine arabinoside) administered as an up-front treatment?&#xd;
&#xd;
  2. Secondary Research Question What is the incidence of life-threatening toxicities&#xd;
     (grade 3 and 4, according to WHO criteria, Appendix A) in the patients?</textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>Alemtuzumab (Campath-1H) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets CD52, a cell&#xd;
surface protein present at high density on most normal and malignant B and T lymphocytes.&#xd;
&#xd;
CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone) is currently regarded&#xd;
as a standard chemotherapy regimen for patients with newly diagnosed NHL.&#xd;
&#xd;
ESHAP (etoposide, methylprednisolone, cisplatin, cytosine arabinoside) chemotherapy was&#xd;
invented in 1994. The regimen was aimed to salvage NHL patients who were relapsing or&#xd;
refractory to front-line, mostly doxorubicin-based, chemotherapy.Major toxicities were&#xd;
myelosuppression; 30% of the patients developed febrile neutropenia and was admitted for&#xd;
parenteral antibiotics. Treatment-related deaths, mostly from uncontrolled sepsis,&#xd;
occurred in 4% of the patients. Because of its efficacy and tolerable toxicities, at&#xd;
present, ESHAP is one of the salvage chemotherapy regimens most frequently administered&#xd;
to patients especially prior to autologous stem cell transplantation.&#xd;
&#xd;
Recently, our unit had reported the efficacy of the combination of standard CHOP&#xd;
chemotherapy and ESHAP and high-dose therapy with autologous stem cell transplantation or&#xd;
rituximab given as upfront therapy in patients newly diagnosed as poor prognosis&#xd;
aggressive NHL (high- and high-intermediate risk groups according to the international&#xd;
index).15,16 According to the previous institutional experience as well as the efficacy&#xd;
of the combination of CHOP and ESHAP in patients with high-risk aggressive lymphoma, we&#xd;
would like therefore to determine the outcome of alemtuzumab given in combination with&#xd;
CHOP and ESHAP in patients newly diagnosed with PTCL, the effectiveness of which has not&#xd;
been known.</textblock>
