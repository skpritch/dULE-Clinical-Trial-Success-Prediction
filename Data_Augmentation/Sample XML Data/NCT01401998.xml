  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>In 2005, The University of Alabama at Birmingham established a NIDDK-funded,&#xd;
interdisciplinary center of excellence in PKD-related research, with specific emphasis on&#xd;
recessive PKD. In the previous Core Center award period, we developed a Core Resource to&#xd;
capture clinical and mutational data for ARPKD patients ("Core A: ARPKD Clinical and&#xd;
Genetic Resource", NCT00575705). However, studies in the last several years have&#xd;
demonstrated that ARPKD and other single gene disorders characterized by renal cystic&#xd;
disease and extra-renal phenotypes share numerous pathogenic features. In the current&#xd;
competitively- renewed Center, we have expanded this Core resource to include other&#xd;
hepato/renal fibrocystic diseases.&#xd;
&#xd;
Goals for the Core A: The Hepato/Renal Fibrocystic Diseases Translational Resource are:&#xd;
&#xd;
  1. &#xd;
&#xd;
       -  Clinical Database:&#xd;
&#xd;
     â€¢ Expand our comprehensive Clinical Database to include information from all&#xd;
     patients who meet the inclusion criteria for hepato/renal fibrocystic diseases.&#xd;
&#xd;
  2. &#xd;
&#xd;
       -  Mutational Database:&#xd;
&#xd;
       -  Test children with ARPKD and other hepato/renal fibrocystic disease to identify&#xd;
          genetic mutations, establish a DNA bank for patients with hepato/renal&#xd;
          fibrocystic diseases and develop a Mutational Database. This Database will be&#xd;
          capable of linking clinical and mutational information via a unique identifier&#xd;
          in a searchable format to facilitate genetic research (e.g. genotype-phenotype&#xd;
          correlations, new disease gene studies, and modifier gene studies),&#xd;
          translational studies, and clinical trials.&#xd;
&#xd;
          3- Tissue Resource:&#xd;
&#xd;
       -  Much of the research that is performed on diseases of the kidney, including&#xd;
          recessive genetic diseases, requires human tissue from both affected as well as&#xd;
          non-affected (controls) individuals. In this Core Resource, we are establishing&#xd;
          an independent tissue resource which would supply investigators throughout&#xd;
          North America with samples of hepato/renal fibrocystic disease affected tissues&#xd;
          for studies of these disorders.&#xd;
&#xd;
          4- Educational Resource:&#xd;
&#xd;
       -  Expand our multi-media, web-based resource to provide a reliable up-to-date,&#xd;
          and comprehensive informational resource for ARPKD and Hepato/Renal Diseases&#xd;
          families, their physicians, and genetic counselors.</textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>For patients/families who are interested in the study and verbally or written agree to be&#xd;
contacted by the main site (CHOP), the study coordinators may send contact information of&#xd;
these potential participants to CHOP for screening and recruitment purposes. Any patients&#xd;
who verbally agree to be contacted will be documented by the study team, either in a log&#xd;
or note to file. If the participant verbally agrees to be contacted by CHOP, the study&#xd;
team will pass their contact information along to the CHOP study team, via secure email.&#xd;
The study team at CHOP will then personally reach out, recruit, and enroll the interested&#xd;
patients at other sites.&#xd;
&#xd;
Email Recruitment:&#xd;
&#xd;
The study team may recruit by sending an email blast with a flyer. The flyer will be for&#xd;
recruitment directly through CHOP or collaborating sites.&#xd;
&#xd;
In-Person Consent Process:&#xd;
&#xd;
Step 1: Recruitment of ARPKD/HRFD patients will occur based on provider referrals or&#xd;
participants directly contacting the study team from departments such as CHOP Nephrology,&#xd;
Dialysis, Transplant, and CHOP Nephrology/GI combined clinics. Potential participants&#xd;
will be approached over the phone or via email or in person. Prospective subjects&#xd;
expressing interest in participation will be approached by a study team member (PI or&#xd;
study coordinator) in person or by telephone to explain the study and will provide&#xd;
information regarding opportunities to participate in hepato-renal fibrocystic diseases&#xd;
research to patients. The participant will be informed that their decision to participate&#xd;
or not participate in a research study will not influence their clinical care.&#xd;
&#xd;
Step 2: The participant/parent/legally authorized representative will complete their&#xd;
contact information and their physician contact information (via RedCap).&#xd;
&#xd;
Step 3: The CHOP PI / Coordinator will obtain signed informed consent by&#xd;
participant/parent/legally authorized representative during site visit. The&#xd;
participant/parent/legally authorized representative will receive a copy of the signed&#xd;
consent in person Step 4: Once the research coordinator receives the signed copy of the&#xd;
Informed Consent and the physician's contact information, they will verify the contact&#xd;
information. The research staff enter clinical data into the Hepato-Renal Fibrocystic&#xd;
Diseases clinical database using the web-based data entry forms.&#xd;
&#xd;
Verbal Consent Process:&#xd;
&#xd;
Eligible participants will be contacted via telephone. They will be given ample time to&#xd;
discuss the study, ask questions, and consider participation. If the participant agrees&#xd;
to the optional genetic testing blood draw, written consent will be sought in person when&#xd;
the blood draw will happen. If in person written consent cannot be obtained, written&#xd;
consent will be obtained either through email, mail, or a REDCap econsent.</textblock>

    <description>Core A: The Hepato/Renal Fibrocystic Diseases Translational Resource:&#xd;
&#xd;
The aims of this Core are:&#xd;
&#xd;
  -  Expand our current clinical and mutational database and establish a DNA bank&#xd;
&#xd;
  -  Establish a national tissue repository for hepato/renal fibrocystic diseases&#xd;
&#xd;
  -  Broaden the portfolio of educational tools developed for physicians and patients to&#xd;
     encompass the hepato/renal fibrocystic diseases spectrum of disorders.&#xd;
&#xd;
A unique aspect of this Core is that it builds on established clinical, genotyping, and&#xd;
educational programs and through the P30 mechanism will make these data/resources&#xd;
available to the broader community of interested investigators</description>
