             3 weeks prior to baseline and that treatment is not expected to change during the
             course of the trial; or, if their DEXA measure was abnormally low and they are not
             receiving treatment for osteoporosis/osteopenia, they may proceed to baseline after 3

               -  Non-target lesions include all other lesions not included in above, including
                  small lesions with longest diameter < 20 mm with conventional techniques or < 10
                  mm with spiral CT scan and truly non-measurable lesions, which include:

                    -  Bone lesions

                    -  Pleural or pericardial effusions, ascites

                    -  CNS lesions, leptomeningeal disease

                    -  Irradiated lesions, unless progression documented after RT

          -  Patients must have demonstrated evidence of progressive disease since the most recent
             change in therapy; progressive disease is defined as any one of the following
             (measurable disease, bone scan, or PSA progression):

               -  Measurable Disease Progression: Objective evidence of increase > 20% in the sum
                  of the longest diameters (LD) of target lesions from the time of maximal
                  regression or the appearance of one or more new lesions

               -  Bone Scan Progression: Appearance of one or more new lesions on bone scan
                  attributable to prostate cancer along with a PSA ≥ 5 ng/ml will constitute
                  progression

               -  PSA Progression: An elevated PSA (≥ 5 ng/mL) which has risen serially on at least
                  two occasions after the discontinuation of antiandrogen therapy, each at least
                  one week apart; if the confirmatory PSA (#3) value is less than screening PSA
                  (#2) value, then an additional test for rising PSA (#4) will be required to
                  document progression

                    -  The reference PSA value (#1) must be measured at the time of the
                       discontinuation of antiandrogen therapy; and at least 2 PSA measurements
                       must be made following the end of antiandrogen therapy and prior to
                       registration

                    -  (For the purposes of the nomogram calculator, the last PSA value recorded
                       prior to the initiation of treatment will be considered the baseline PSA)

          -  Progression despite standard androgen deprivation therapy (i.e., LHRH agonist and/or
             orchiectomy)

          -  All antiandrogens (e.g., flutamide, megestrol acetate [even if taken for hot flashes],
             bicalutamide and nilutamide) of any dose must be discontinued at least 4 weeks prior
             to registration; if improvement following antiandrogen withdrawal is noted,
             progression must be established using the criteria above

               -  Primary testicular androgen suppression (e.g., with an LHRH agonist) should not
                  be discontinued

          -  At least 4 weeks since any other hormonal therapy, including ketoconazole and
             aminoglutethimide; the only exception to this time frame is that 5α-reductase
             inhibitors (e.g., finasteride, dutasteride) may be discontinued any time prior to
             registration

          -  No prior cytotoxic chemotherapy, including estramustine or suramin

          -  No prior anti-angiogenesis agents, including thalidomide and bevacizumab

          -  ≥ 4 weeks since major surgery and fully recovered

          -  ≥ 4 weeks since any prior radiation (including palliative) and fully recovered

          -  Patients receiving a bisphosphonate must be on a stable dose and must have started the
             bisphosphonate ≥ 4 weeks prior to initiating protocol treatment. Patients do not have
             to be on a bisphosphonate to qualify for the study; patients may initiate
             bisphosphonate therapy after completion of Cycle 1, if clinically indicated

               -  Patients enrolled on CALGB 90202 who have documented disease progression and have
                  received at least 4 weeks of open label zoledronic acid treatment, are eligible

             of the investigator (at the completion of the previous tipranavir trial), then the
             subject may enroll in 1182.17 once the clinical illness has resolved, and after
             approval from the Boehringer Ingelheim Clinical Monitor or Local Clinical Monitor.

          7. Clinically significant liver disease in the 90 days prior to baseline visit,

             tumor, a primary tumor block, or cytologic preparation must be available for review.
             COX-II expression is seen in the majority of patients with these tumor types. Effects
             of COX-II inhibitors occur even in the absence of COX-II expression and will be
             measured with other IHC staining, apoptosis studies and gene expression. Therefore,
             patients will not be tested for COX-II expression preoperatively in order to include
             them in the study.

        A patient will be considered for inclusion in this study only if all of the following
        criteria apply:

          -  Signed written informed consent.

          -  Diagnosis of clear cell RCC that is predominantly clear cell histology. Note: cytology
             cannot be the only pathologic criteria to confirm clear cell RCC. Patients with tumor
             types that are interpreted as non-clear cell, e.g. papillary, are excluded.

          -  Locally advanced RCC (defined as disease not amenable to curative surgery or radiation
             therapy) or metastatic RCC (equivalent to Stage IV RCC according to American Joint
             Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging.

          -  Note: If the metastatic disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic
             nature must be confirmed by histology or cytology. Cytology cannot be the only
             pathologic criteria to confirm clear cell RCC, but can be used in a patient with
             histologically confirmed clear cell RCC to confirm that metastatic disease is
             neoplastic in nature.

          -  Must have measurable disease, i.e. presenting with at least one measurable lesion per
             Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). A measurable lesion is defined
             as a lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension with the longest
             diameter ≥ 20 mm using conventional techniques, or ≥ 10 mm with spiral CT scan.

          -  Note: Patient should be excluded if all baseline measurable lesions are within
             previously irradiated areas.

          -  Note: A patient must complete all the baseline disease assessments in order to be
             eligible. Baseline head, chest, abdominal and pelvic CT or MRI scans must be performed
             within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study medication; baseline bone scan must be
             performed within 3 weeks of the first dose of study medication.

          -  Patients who have received only one prior systemic treatment for locally advanced or
             metastatic RCC with documented disease progression or documented treatment
             discontinuation due to unacceptable toxicity. This first-line systemic treatment must
             be cytokine based.

          -  Note: The first-line cytokine-based treatment can be interleukin-2 (IL-2) or
             interferon-α (INFα) monotherapy, IL-2 in combination with INF-α, IL-2 and/or INF-α in
             combination with chemotherapy, hormonal or other therapies excluding agents targeting
             angiogenesis pathways. Agents in a combination regimen can be given sequentially if
             the treatment sequence is pre-determined and the patient does not fail one agent prior
             to starting another.

          -  Note: Prior adjuvant or neo-adjuvant therapies are permitted excluding any agents that
             target vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or VEGF receptors. The
             adjuvant/neo-adjuvant therapies should not be considered as first-line systemic
             treatment for advanced RCC.

        Or,

          -  Patients who have received no prior systemic therapy for advanced/metastatic RCC can
             be enrolled if under any of the following circumstances:

          -  Patients who live in countries or regions where there is no established standard
             first-line therapy for advanced/metastatic RCC or where there are barriers to the

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) must be greater than/equal to 1200/mm3.

               -  Platelet count must be greater than/equal to 100,000/mm^3.

               -  Hemoglobin must be greater than/equal to 10 g/dL.

          -  The following criteria for evidence of adequate hepatic function must be met:

               -  total bilirubin must be less than/equal to upper limit of normal (ULN) for the
                  lab unless the patient has a grade 1 bilirubin elevation (greater than ULN to 1.5
                  x ULN) due to Gilbert's disease or similar syndrome involving slow conjugation of
                  bilirubin; and

               -  alkaline phosphatase must be less than 2.5 x ULN for the lab; and

               -  aspartate aminotransferase (AST) must be less than/equal to 1.5 x ULN for the
                  lab.

               -  Alkaline phosphatase and AST may not both be greater than the ULN. For example,
                  if the alkaline phosphatase is greater than the ULN but less than/equal to 2.5 x
                  ULN, then the AST must be less than/equal to the ULN. If the AST is greater than
                  the ULN but less than/equal to 1.5 x ULN, then the alkaline phosphatase must be
                  less than/equal to ULN.

          -  Patients with either skeletal pain or alkaline phosphatase that is greater than ULN
             but less than/equal to 2.5 x ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if a bone
             scan or positron emission tomography (PET) scan does not demonstrate metastatic
             disease. Patients with suspicious findings on bone scan or PET scan are eligible if
             suspicious findings are confirmed as benign by x-ray, magnetic resonance imaging
             (MRI), or biopsy.

          -  Patients with AST or alkaline phosphatase greater than ULN are eligible for inclusion
             in the study if liver imaging (computed tomography [CT], MRI, or PET scan) does not
             demonstrate metastatic disease and adequate hepatic function.

          -  The following criteria for evidence of adequate renal function must be met:

               -  Serum creatinine less than/equal to ULN for the lab.

               -  Calculated creatinine clearance must be greater than 50 mL/min.

          -  Urine protein/creatinine (UPC) ratio must be less than 1.0.

          -  Patients must have their left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) assessed by
             multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram within 3 months prior to study
             entry. The LVEF must be greater than/equal to the lower limit of normal (LLN) for the
             cardiac imaging facility performing the MUGA scan or echocardiogram. Note: If the
             cardiac imaging facility cannot provide a LLN, use 50% as the LLN value.

        Note: Since the pre-entry LVEF serves as the baseline for comparing subsequent LVEF
        assessments to determine if bevacizumab therapy can be continued following doxorubicin and
        cyclophosphamide (AC) and postoperatively, it is critical that this baseline study be an
        accurate assessment of the patient's LVEF. If the baseline LVEF is greater than 65%, the
        MUGA scan or echocardiogram must be repeated prior to study entry. The lower of the two
        LVEF values should be used as the baseline LVEF.

          -  Patients must have an electrocardiogram (EKG) within 3 months prior to study entry.

             uncontrolled congestive heart failure,and cardiomyopathy with decreased ejection
             fraction, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because carboplatin, paclitaxel, cetuximab
             and radiation therapy have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants
             secondary to treatment of the mother with the above agents, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with the agents used in this study. These
             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.

          -  Patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections when
             treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Therefore, HIV-positive patients receiving

        and other pertinent information on the investigational product that may impact patient
        eligibility is provided in the pazopanib IB and lapatinib prescribing information (or the
        lapatinib IB).

        For Cohort 1 of this study, eligible patients met inclusion criteria outlined in the
        original version of the protocol and protocol amendment 1.

        For Cohort 2 of this study, eligible patients must meet all of the following criteria:

          -  Patients must have evaluable Inflammatory Breast Cancer (IBC) substantiated by all of
             the following prior to randomization:

          -  History of invasive breast cancer documented by a biopsy and accompanying pathology
             report

          -  Current photographs* (global view and close-up views of all skin lesions) submitted at
             screening demonstrating unequivocal evidence of IBC as determined by either the
             medical monitor alone or in consultation with one or more of the study Principal
             Investigators.

          -  All patients must have photography at screening. Canfield Scientific Inc. will provide
             centralized monitoring, tracking, and collection of patients' photographs throughout
             the study. Screening photographs must be uploaded to the Canfield Scientific Inc
             website and approved by Canfield Scientific Inc, as the central photography vendor.
             The photographs, along with the completed Inflammatory Breast Cancer Skin Assessment
             Tool (IBSAT), must be reviewed and approved by GSK before a patient can be randomized.
             Sites should allow a minimum of 3 business days for this process. Sites submitting
             quality photographs and IBSATs on a regular basis will receive an exemption from this
             requirement for future patients.

          -  Patients with secondary IBC are eligible.

          -  Measurable lesions (cutaneous or radiographic) may be in the field of prior standard
             or palliative radiation therapy; however, there must be at least a 4 week period
             between the last radiation treatment and the baseline scan documenting disease status
             for the lesion to be measurable. If the irradiated lesion is the only site of disease,
             documented progression of the irradiated lesion is required.

          -  Disease progression or relapse following treatment for invasive breast cancer, which
             must have included a chemotherapy regimen. In regions where trastuzumab is available
             with no barriers to access*, patients must have received prior trastuzumab in addition
             to chemotherapy in order to be eligible. * (Barriers to access may include financial
             considerations.)

             immunohistochemistry (IHC), or 2+ staining by IHC in conjunction with ErbB2 gene
             amplification by FISH/CISH, or ErbB2 gene amplification by FISH/CISH alone (in
             subjects whose tumor blocks were not assessed by IHC). ErbB2 gene amplification is
             defined by: > six (6) ErbB2 gene copies/nucleus for test systems without an internal
             control probe or an ErbB2/CEP 17 ratio of more than 2.2.

        Sites must submit a copy of the laboratory report demonstrating unequivocal ErbB2
        overexpression, if testing performed at a local laboratory, with the screening worksheet.
        Archived tumor must be provided for all patients for ErbB2 FISH testing by the central
        laboratory. Patients will remain on study based on local ErbB2 expression results. If
        archived tumor is not available, a biopsy must be obtained at screening and sent to TMD
        Laboratories for ErbB2 FISH testing.

        - Patients must provide written informed consent prior to performance of study-specific
        procedures or assessments, and must be willing to comply with treatment and follow up.
        Procedures conducted as part of the patient's routine clinical management (e.g., blood
        count, imaging study) and obtained prior to signing of informed consent may be utilized for
        screening or baseline purposes provided these procedures are conducted as specified in the
        protocol.

        Note: Informed consent may be obtained prior to the protocol-specified screening window
        (i.e. Day -14 to Day -1).

             eligible.

          -  Cardiac ejection fraction within the institutional range of normal as measured by
             echocardiogram. MUGA scans will be accepted in cases where an echocardiogram cannot be
             performed or is inconclusive or where MUGA scans are the accepted standard. Patients
             with known history of uncontrolled or symptomatic angina, arrhythmias, or congestive
             heart failure are not eligible.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2.

             estradiol value < 40pg/mL (<140 pmol/L).

        Patients must discontinue HRT prior to study enrollment due to the potential for inhibition
        of CYP enzymes that metabolize estrogens and progestins (See Section 8). For most forms of
        HRT, at least 2-4 weeks must elapse between the cessation of HRT and determination of
        menopausal status; length of this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. If a
        female patient is determined not to be post-menopausal, they must use adequate
        contraception, as defined immediately below.

        Childbearing potential, including any female who has had a negative serum pregnancy test
        within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment, preferably as close to the first
        dose as possible, has used adequate contraception since the pregnancy test and agrees to
        use adequate contraception as described below. GSK acceptable contraceptive methods, when
        used consistently and in accordance with both the product label and the instructions of the
        physician, are as follow:

             film; diaphragm with spermicide; or male condom and diaphragm with spermicide).

        Note: Oral contraceptives are not reliable due to potential drug drug interactions.

        Female patients who are lactating should discontinue nursing prior to the first dose of
        investigational product and should refrain from nursing throughout the treatment period and
        for 14 days following the last dose of investigational product.

          -  The effects of oxaliplatin, capecitabine and sorafenib on the developing human fetus
             at the recommended therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason and because DNA
             alkylating agents are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and
             men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth

             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study,
             she should inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  Because the risk of toxicity in nursing infants secondary to oxaliplatin treatment of
             the mother is unknown but may be harmful, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated with oxaliplatin.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No concomitant radiation therapy, or other systemic cancer therapies.

             study drug, serious non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture, evidence or history of
             bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy.

          -  Pregnant or nursing women are excluded from this study because oxaliplatin,
             capecitabine and sorafenib is a DNA alkylating agent with the potential for
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Female patients of reproductive potential must
             have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within two weeks prior to enrolling.

          -  Major surgery, open biopsy or significant traumatic injury within 4 weeks of first
             study drug.

          -  Because of drug interactions with sorafenib, use of St. John's Wort or rifampin

             same vessels can be included but at least one lesion should require implantation of
             two DES in overlapping with a total stent length > 33 mm. The definition of
             multivessel disease requires an intention to treat at least two lesions (with a least
             one with the characteristics reported above) in two different major epicardial
             segments. For example, the presence of a lesion in the left anterior descending artery
             and in the obtuse marginal or the presence of a lesions in the right postero-lateral
             branch and in a diagonal branch will qualify as multivessel. The presence of lesions
             in the left anterior descending artery and in the diagonal branch will not qualify as
             multivessel. Bifurcation lesions and ostial lesions can be included, but only if at
             least two DES in overlapping with a total stent length > 33 mm are implanted in the
             same branch. When treating diffuse lesion in the same vessel, overlapping stenting is
             recommended with high pressure (>14 atm post-dilation) of the overlap zone. There is
             no maximum stent length to treat one coronary vessel.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of squamous
             cell carcinoma of the head and neck, with recurrent or metastatic disease.

          2. Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >20
             mm with conventional techniques or as >10 mm with spiral CT scan. See Section 11 for
             the evaluation of measurable disease.

          3. Patients must have had no prior monoclonal antibodies or small molecule
             tyrosine-kinase inhibitors for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic SCCHN. In
             addition, no prior chemotherapy for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic SCCHN is
             allowed.

          4. If the patient has had previous radiation to the marker lesion(s), there must be
             evidence of progression since the radiation. Patients must be greater than or equal to
             12 weeks from completion of prior curative intent therapy including surgery,
             radiation, or systemic anticancer therapy. If palliative radiation therapy is given
             for recurrent or metastatic disease, patients must be greater than or equal to four
             weeks from treatment.

          5. No concurrent malignancy except curatively treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of
             the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix. Patients with prior history of

                  institutional normal 3.1.8

         10. As the investigational agent RAD001 requires enteral administration, patients must be
             able to receive adequate enteral nutrition by mouth or through a G-tube device.

         11. The effects of RAD001 on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic
             dose are unknown. For this reason and because agents used in this trial are known to
             be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study
             entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or
             suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her
             treating physician immediately.

         12. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          2. Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          3. Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

          4. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to RAD001 or other agents used in the study.

          5. Patients receiving any medications or substances that are inhibitors or inducers of
             the isoenzyme CYP3A are ineligible. Lists including medications and substances known
             or with the potential to interact with the CYP3A isoenzymes are provided in the
             appendix.

          6. Patients receiving chronic treatment with systemic steroids or other immunosuppressive
             agents are ineligible.

          7. Patients with a known hypersensitivity to RAD001 (everolimus) or other rapamycin
             (sirolimus, temsirolimus) or its excipients.

          8. Impairment of gastrointestinal function or gastrointestinal disease that may
             significantly alter the absorption of RAD001 (e.g. ulcerative disease; uncontrolled
             nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea; malabsorption syndrome or small bowel resection).

          9. Patients with active bleeding diathesis or patients on oral anti-vitamin K agent
             (excluding low dose warfarin).

         10. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, severely impaired lung function or psychiatric illness/social situations
             that would limit compliance with study requirements Severely impaired lung function is
             defined as spirometry and DLCO that is 50% of the normal predicted value and /or O2
             saturation that is 88% or less on room air.

         11. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because RAD001 is a mTOR inhibitor with
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with RAD001, breastfeeding should be discontinued. These potential risks may
             also apply to other agents used in this study.

         12. HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with RAD001. In addition, these
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with ZD6474, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated with ZD6474.
